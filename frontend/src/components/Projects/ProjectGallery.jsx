/**
 * ProjectGallery component renders a gallery view for a project with options to toggle between 2D and 3D views.
 * It also includes a header with controls to switch views and open a specifications drawer.
 * The component uses the spacecraftData object to render the project details.
 * The spacecraftData object contains the project overview, stats, technologies, specifications, and views.
 * The views data includes images and descriptions of the project from different angles.
 * The component uses the GalleryView, ThreeDView, InfoTabs, and SpecificationsDrawer components to render the project details.
