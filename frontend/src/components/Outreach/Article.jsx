        Space tourism is no longer a dream; it's becoming a reality. With private companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic leading the way, the industry is evolving rapidly. 
        Politorbital team, a research group from Politecnico di Torino, has been developing cutting-edge suborbital spacecraft designs to make space travel more accessible. 
        
        In this article, we explore the engineering behind these spacecraft, the challenges of space travel, and the potential for commercial space tourism in the coming decade.
        
        ## The Rise of Space Tourism
        The concept of space tourism dates back to the early days of space exploration. However, recent advancements in reusable rocket technology have made it more viable. 
        Companies are now offering suborbital and orbital experiences to private citizens, creating a new era of space travel.
        
        ## Challenges & Innovations
        Some of the major challenges of space tourism include:
        
        - **Cost Efficiency**: Making space travel affordable for more people.
        - **Safety Measures**: Ensuring safe launches, landings, and in-flight experiences.
        - **Sustainable Space Travel**: Reducing environmental impact through innovative fuel sources.
        
        ## Whatâ€™s Next?
        Experts predict that within the next 10-20 years, we could see orbital hotels, lunar tourism, and even deep-space missions open to civilians.
